A climber selects a route 2-3 grades below their onsight level on a vertical wall. Instead of using the most obvious or convenient footholds, they deliberately seek out higher options that require lifting the foot to waist level or above. For each high step, they focus on proper technique: turning the hip outward (external rotation), keeping the body close to the wall, and using core tension to generate upward movement. The exercise progresses by selecting increasingly higher footholds that challenge the limits of mobility. A good benchmark is attempting to place the foot at or above the level of the opposite hand, requiring significant hip flexibility and core strength. This drill can be practiced for 15-20 minutes as part of a technical training session, targeting 8-10 deliberate high steps.

A climber sets up or finds a traverse with multiple holds at the same height. Starting with both hands on holds, they reach across their body with one arm crossing over or under the other to grasp the next hold in sequence, without releasing the original hold. After securing the cross-through position, they bring their other hand past to continue the sequence. The climber focuses on maintaining body tension throughout the movement, using hip rotation and weight shifts to facilitate reaching. Advanced practice involves "elbow drops" (crossing under) and exploring different body positions during the cross. For a structured drill, the climber might perform 3-4 traverses of 10-15 moves each, deliberately incorporating at least 5-6 cross-throughs per traverse. This develops the coordination and body awareness needed for efficient movement on routes with complicated sequences.

A climber selects routes several grades below their maximum level and commits to climbing them exclusively with open-hand grips (no full crimping allowed). On each hold, they focus on keeping their fingers relaxed and slightly curved rather than sharply bent at the joints. Initially, this might feel insecure, especially on smaller edges, but with practice becomes more comfortable and efficient. The climber might start with 15-20 minutes of focused practice on easier terrain before incorporating the technique into more challenging climbs. A good progression is to first master open-hand technique on jugs and positive edges, then gradually apply it to smaller holds and finally to micro-edges where possible. Regular practice of open-hand gripping not only reduces injury risk but develops forearm strength in a range of motion that transfers well to sloper-intensive climbing.

A climber selects a route 2-3 grades below their onsight level and commits to climbing it at about 1/3 their normal pace. Before each hand movement, they pause for 3-5 seconds on the current holds, consciously analyzing their body position, breathing, and the upcoming sequence. They move to the next hold with deliberate control, then pause again. For foot placements, they take time to visually identify the optimal position on the foothold before placing their foot with precision. A typical slow climbing session might involve 2-3 routes climbed in this manner, taking 10-15 minutes per route that would normally require only 3-5 minutes. This practice develops several crucial skills for onsighting: efficient resting positions, movement planning while on the wall, and the mental discipline to climb methodically under fatigue. Advanced practitioners might incorporate breath control, climbing sections of the route with eyes closed, or deliberately planning multiple moves ahead during each pause.

A climber selects a route with several potential rest positions (jugs with good feet, stems in corners, knee bars, etc.).

Once the optimal position is found, they practice relaxing one arm at a time, shaking out while maintaining body position through core engagement. The climber focuses on controlled breathing (deep belly breaths) and mental relaxation during the rest. They hold each optimized rest position for 30-60 seconds before moving to the next section. After practicing individual rest positions, they climb the entire route, incorporating strategic rests at predetermined points. This exercise teaches climbers to identify potential rest opportunities, maximize recovery efficiency, and develop the mental discipline to take rests when needed rather than rushing through routes.

A climber sets up or finds a series of dynamic moves of increasing difficulty. They begin with small deadpoint movements (where one hand remains on the wall) between closely spaced holds, focusing on generating momentum through the legs and core rather than arms alone. Once comfortable with deadpoints, they progress to full dynos where both hands leave the wall simultaneously. For each movement, they practice the setup position, identifying the optimal body position that allows them to generate maximum momentum toward the target hold. The climber performs 6-8 attempts at each dynamic move, taking adequate rest between attempts to maintain quality. Throughout the practice, they focus on controlled takeoffs, accurate targeting, and solid catching technique - maintaining body tension throughout the movement and engaging the core upon contact with the target hold. This progressive approach builds both physical capability and the mental confidence needed for committing to dynamic movements during routes or boulders.
